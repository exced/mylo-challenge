# Front-end challenge

Welcome to my frontend-(full stack for fun)-challenge project.

This project is divided into 3 folders :

api : Part1 backend using Express, GraphQL, MongoDB, passport

web : Part1 frontend using React, Redux, Redux Saga, Apollo GraphQL

static : Part2 frontend using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap

## Getting started

### Project 1
Details to install the api and the web server are in api/ and web/ folders.

You will need : mongo daemon running, NodeJS server installed and a package manager such as Yarn or NPM.

#### Terminal 1
```bash
cd api
yarn
yarn start
```

#### Terminal 2
```bash
cd web
yarn
yarn start
```

You can now go to localhost:3000 to see the website running.
I added a login / signin page. You can register or login with already existing accounts you gave me in the paper using username as password.

For instance you can log in with "Joe" / "Joe".

After logging in, you'll see an empty home page. Use navigation menu to go to Users page. Here you'll see a simple list of users that you can play with.

You can update users or delete them if you want to.

### Project 2

This project is pretty simple and has been made from scratch.
Just open index.html inside static/ folder.

```bash
cd static
open index.html
```
